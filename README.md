## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

One of the things many find sorely lacking in the Bioware NPCs are the more complex relationships presented by modern NPC mods--especially in regards to "*friendships*", the relationships NPCs have with the PC when not romancing them.

This mod adds a series of dialogues with Valygar.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

The Valygar Friendship mod should be compatible with all WeiDU mods, however, we cannot test every single one. It is only compatible with BGII: ToB. If you do encounter an error, please let us know by posting the message at our forums</a>.

>Although it is not required for the Valygar Friendship to function properly, it is always a good idea to install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a>.

Known Issues: The Valygar Friendship should work fine with Corthala Romantique, but switching between romance and friendship may deactivate some dialogues. We hope to make it work better in the future version of the mod.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-valygarfriendship.exe`**, un-install the previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: valygarfriendship folder.</em>

<em>When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.</em>

**Disable any antivirus** or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: valygarfriendship folder and a setup-valygarfriendship.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-valygarfriendship.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-valygarfriendship.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the component settings.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-valygarfriendship --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
